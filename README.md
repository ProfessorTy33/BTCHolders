Tracking accumulation behavior across the 100 richest Bitcoin addresses using on-chain analysis.

Key Patterns
1. Exchange Wallets Are Stacking
Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, OKEx, BitMex, and Crypto.com are actively increasing cold storage holdings. This suggests:
  Growing user deposits
  Institutional inflows
  Long-term BTC storage strategies

2. Tether Resumes Accumulation
Tether's wallet shows activity for the first time in four months, potentially to:
  Rebalance USDT reserves
  Hedge against macro instability

3. Emerging Whales
Multiple unknown wallets (especially ranks #30, #46, #48, #50) are:
  Recently created
  Accumulating BTC in large amounts
  Possibly representing hedge funds, OTC desks, or sovereign entities


Implications: 
  Accumulation from whales + low retail sell pressure = supply shock potential
  Institutional Repositioning
  Cold wallet growth from exchanges suggests long-term plays

These institutions may be preparing for regulatory clarity, ETF inflows, or geopolitical hedging
